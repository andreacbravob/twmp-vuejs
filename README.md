# VueJS Documentation Audit 

[![Built with Starlight](https://astro.badg.es/v2/built-with-starlight/tiny.svg)](https://starlight.astro.build)

For this assignment, I had to recreate the Vuejs documentation using the Astro Starlight Theme. 

It involved auditing and reworking the docs to a high standard.

I had to recreate at least five pages in each category on the docs, and all pages if the section had less than five pages.
